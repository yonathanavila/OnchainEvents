# Project Description

MailThereum OnChain Events is a blockchain-based platform designed to streamline the event planning and management process while providing attendees with a secure and transparent experience. The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring the immutability and integrity of all event data.

The platform allows event organizers to create and manage events, send invitations and updates to attendees via email, and track attendance and payments in real-time. Attendees can pay for tickets and other event-related expenses using cryptocurrencies, eliminating the need for traditional payment methods and providing a more secure and convenient payment option.

The platform leverages smart contracts to automate the event management process, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring that all transactions are executed in a secure and transparent manner. This also helps to reduce the risk of fraud and other security breaches.

One of the key features of MailThereum OnChain Events is its use of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to provide attendees with a tamper-proof record of their participation in events without disclosing any personal information. Attendees' identities are verified during registration, and a unique identifier is stored on the blockchain. During the event, attendees' presence is recorded on the blockchain using their unique identifier. After the event, attendees can request a proof of attendance without revealing their identity. The platform generates a ZKP that proves their presence at the event, without disclosing any additional personal information.

MailThereum OnChain Events provides a transparent and secure platform for event management, leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of event data and reduce the risk of fraud and other security breaches. By providing a seamless and efficient event management process, organizers can focus on delivering high-quality events, while attendees can enjoy a hassle-free and secure experience.

## Revenue opportunities
- Transaction Fees: The platform could charge a transaction fee for each ticket sale and payment made on the platform. This fee could be a percentage of the total transaction amount or a flat fee.

- Sponsorship and Advertising: The platform could offer advertising opportunities to event sponsors. Sponsors could place ads on the platform or within event invitations and updates, providing an additional revenue stream for the platform.
